SET UP PSUEDO CODE

THIS WILL POPULATE PSQL DATA BEFORE TRAINING

for ROUND in range(number of rounds of data we want):
    for NODE in [list of nodes name]:
        (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = self.local_training_handler.data_handler.load_dataset(nb_points=50)
        save [ROUND,(x_train, y_train)] to table "<NODE>-train"
        save [ROUND,(x_test, y_test)] to table "<NODE>-test"
